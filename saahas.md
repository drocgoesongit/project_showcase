Our volunteer-based assistance application enables volunteers to input details of individuals in need of scholarships or government assistance due to special needs. The application features a comprehensive form for collecting information on the individual's living situation and family dynamics. Collected data is stored in a database and accessible via an admin panel, allowing administrators to view, filter, and evaluate eligibility for scholarships or donations. With 300 individuals already registered, our application continues to expand its impact.
